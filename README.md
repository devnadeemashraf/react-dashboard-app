# React Dashboard Project with 10K+ Data Points

This was a frontend challenge that I asked **Deepseek r1** to generate for me to test my frontend skills.

This is a real-time dashboard, _with no backend but a mock MirageJS server_, application that handles large datasets efficiently. I have optimized it to perform seamlessly even with over **10,000 rows** of data.

You can read more about the challenge [here](./CHALLENGE.md).
